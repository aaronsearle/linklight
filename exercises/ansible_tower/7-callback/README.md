# Exercise 7 - Tower API Callbacks

We can call into Ansible Tower via the API to run a job template for us.

We'll use the linux-account example we did earlier to demonstate this.

## Adding The Job Template:
Add linux-account.yml

## Enabling Callback:

## Hitting The Callback:
curl example

## End Result
We've explored the Tower API callback facility in order to run a job template.
